A plugin to display ads inside your pages or posts.

== Description ==
The In-Post Ads plugin allows you to save your most used ad codes, and insert them as a shortcode in your pages or posts.

You may already use a plugin to display your ads in a widgetized area of your page such as the left or right sidebars, or in the header or footer of your page. While this does get the ads on the page, your site visitors are not likely to click on them.

This plugin creates shortcodes, which you can use inside the body of any page or post to display an advertisement. This is where your reader's eyes are looking anyway, and it will increase the odds that they will click on the ad.

== Installation ==
1. Download archive and unzip in wp-content/plugins or install via Plugins > Add New.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
3. Copy your ad code from your advertising provider.
4. In your WordPress dashboard, click on Settings > In-Post Ads.
5. Paste your ad code from step 3 into one of the boxes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I already have ads in the sidebar, why would I need this plugin? =

When people read content online, their eyes typically scan the main body of the article they are reading. They do not often stray off into the sidebar unless they are looking for something like a navigational link. They rarely will seek out an ad to click on.

This plugin allows you to put ads in front of your site visitor's eyes, thereby increasing the likelihood that they will click on one of the ads.

= How do I insert an ad in a page or post? =

After you have saved your ad code, simply enter [AdSense-A], [AdSense-B], or [AdSense-C] as appropriate into any page or post where you want your add to appear.

If your site is using the new Gutenberg editor, there are also AdSense A, B, and C blocks that can be inserted into your page or post content. Due to how some ads are rendered, they are not able to show on the back end of your site. A placeholder will be displayed on the page or post edit screen.

= Can I use more than one ad block per page? =

Yes! However, please check your advertising provider's policy regarding the number of ads allowed per page and their general ad placement policies.

https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1346295?hl=en

Currently Google allows a maximum of three ads per page. If you are including an ad in a sidebar widget, which shows up in all pages, please do not add more than two ads to the body of your page or post.

Additionally, think of your site visitors and the user experience associated with multiple ads. If your page or post is only a few lines long, it may be best to limit yourself to just one ad. If your page or post is a few thousand words long, you may be justified in placing several ads throughout the page.

= Can I use ad code from any advertising provider? =

Yes, you can use ad code from almost any source.

Advertising providers like Media.net, BuySellAds, Google AdSense, and others should work just fine.

= If I decide to change the ad code later on, what will happen to the ads currently being shown on my pages or posts? =

If you update the ad code in any of the three boxes, the shortcodes used in your pages or posts will update to reflect the new code. They will continue to be shown in the same location on the page as the old code.

If you delete the ad code, and still have the associated shortcode inside a page or post, it will simply remove the ad from that page or post. You may end up with an extra blank space, but otherwise will see no other difference.

== Screenshots ==
1. Easily insert and save your ad code to insert into your pages and posts.
2. Use shortcodes anywhere in your page or post to insert the ad code.
3. Your ad is now in the body of your article where users are more likely to click it.
